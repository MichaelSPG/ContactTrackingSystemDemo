                    This a demo page to demostrate some of my skills at c# .net core and blazor and more, as required conections to SQL or some else data origins are not implemented here, 
                    just all it's done from memory, you cabn find tow ways to visualize the data with datagrids, take a look and dive into this <code>source code </code>. Also there were more skills to demonstrate more of my skills, but sadly time wasn't enough for that. Have a nice day!
